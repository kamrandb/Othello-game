RandomVSRandom Report

1) What is your conclusion, does the first or
second player has some advantage, at least for a random strategy?

Second player little has little advantage as after executing 10000 games player2 has a probability .54 winning, whereas player1 has 
probability .46

2) Watch https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Iq9DzN6mvYA

3) Briefly write your thoughts on the above video below: 
Above video discusses how important statistics is on top of being quite complicated. Speaker also talks
 about sample-based approach in solution of statistical problems. Speaker claims that even though these 
 problems are hard to understand for people without degree in statistics, having simplest coding skills 
 can help to achieve same results without mathematical complication letting the Python do the job.

4) H0 is statement that in RamdomVsRandom game probability of the first player winning is equal to the probability of the second player winning.
p1 =p 2, where p1 is probability of first player winning, p2 is probability of second player winning

5) Ha is a statement that rejects null hypothesis. In this case Ha is that the probability of the second player winning is not equal to 
probability of the first player winning

7) As in the video, use either math or code (add a Java Class) to argue for or against H0
RandomVSRamdomReport class was created. After running the experiment 1000 the conclusion is Ha is true.
