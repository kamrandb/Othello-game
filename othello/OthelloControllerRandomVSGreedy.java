 * 
 * After executing 10 trials with each try consisting summation of results of 10000 games 
 * Random player has probability of winning .38, whereas Greedy player distinguished 
 * itself by probability of winning .62. Also different trial have been experimented 
 * by changing number of games to 10, 100, 100 and 100000. Overall figures were similar
 * roughly .4 versus.6
 * Therefore the conclusion if Greedy has better chances to win the game.
